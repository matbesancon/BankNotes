# How does predictive modeling work

## Keep the terminology in mind
This is important to understand the principles and
sub-disciplines of machine learning. We are trying to predict a specific
**output**, our information of interest, which is the category of bank note
we observe (genuine or forged).
This task is therefore labelled as **supervised learning**, as opposed to
**unsupervised learning** which consists of finding patterns or groups from
data without a priori identification of those groups.  

Supervised learning can further be labelled as **classification** or
**regression**, depending on the nature of the outcome, respectively
categorical or numerical. It is essential to know because the two disciplines
don't involve the same models. Some models work in both cases but their expected
behavior and performance would be different. In our case, the outcome is
categorical with two levels.  

## How does classification work?

Based on a subset of the data, we train a
model, so we tune it to minimize its error on these data. To make a parallel
with Object-Oriented Programming, the model is an **instance** of the
class which defines how it works. The attributes would be its parameters and
it would always have two methods (functions usable only from the object):  
* **train** the model from a set of observations (composed of predictive
    variables and of the outcome)
* **predict** the outcome given some new observations
Another optional method would be **adapt** which takes new training data and
adjusts/corrects the parameters. A brute-force way to perform this is to call
the train method on both the old and new data, but for some models a more
efficient technique exists.  

## Independent evaluation
A last significant element: we mentioned using only a subset of the data to
train the model. The reason is that the performance of the model has to be
evaluated, but if we compute the error on the training data, the result will
be biased because the model was precisely trained to minimize the error on this
training set. So the evaluation has to be done on a separated subset of the
data, this is called **cross validation**.

# Our model: logistic regression

This model was chosen mostly because
it is visually and intuitively easy to understand and simple to
implement from scratch.
Plus, it covers a central topic in data science, optimization.
The underlying reasoning is the following:  
The logit function of the probability of a level of the classes is
linearly dependent on the predictors. This can be written as:
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"><font size="3">
<img src="http://bit.ly/1ZeK6O0" align="center" border="0" alt="log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot x_1 + \beta_2\cdot x_2 ..." width="304" height="47" />
</font>
</div>

Why do we need the logit function here?
Well technically, a linear regression could be fitted with the class as output
(encoded as 0/1) and the features as predictive variables. However, for some
values of the predictors, the model would yield outputs below 0 or above 1.
The logistic function **equation** yields an output between 0 and 1 and
is therefore well suited to model a probability.

</font>
</div>

You can noticed a decision boundary, which is the limit between the
region where the model yields a prediction "0" and a prediction "1".
The output of the model is a probability of the class "1", the forged
bank notes, so the decision boundary can be put at p=0.5, which would be
our "best guess" for the transition between the two regions.  

## Required parameters

As you noticed in the previous explanation, the model takes a vector of
parameters which correspond to the weights of the different variables.
The intercept \beta_0 places the location of the point at which p=0.5,
it shifts the curve to the right or the left.
The coefficients of the variables correspond to the sharpness of
the transition.

## Learning process

### Parameters identification issue

Unlike linear regression, the learning process for logistic regression is not
a straight-forward computation of the parameters through simple linear algebra
operations. The criterion to optimize is the likelihood, or equivalently, the
log-likelihood of the parameters:
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"><font size="3">
<img src="http://bit.ly/1mPbaXW" align="center" border="0" alt="\mathscr{L}(\beta|(X,Z)) = f_{\beta}\left(X=x,Z=z\right)" width="247" height="21" />
</font>  
</div>  

### Parameters update
The best parameters in the sense of the log-likelihood are therefore found
where this function reaches its maximum.
For the logistic regression problem,
there is only one critical point, which is also the only maximum of the
log-likelihood. So the overall process is to start from a random set of
parameters and to update it in the direction that increases the
log-likelihood the most. This precise direction is given by the
**gradient** of the log-likelihood. The updated weights at each iteration
can be written as:

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"><font size="3">
<img src="http://bit.ly/1mP9PjM" align="center" border="0" alt="\beta^{(n+1)} = \beta^{(n)} + \gamma^{(n)}\nabla(log(\mathscr{L}(\beta^{(n)})))" width="286" height="24" />  
</font>  
</div>  

The optimum is considered as reached when the difference between two
iterations is low enough.

### Optimal learning rate

The coefficient gamma is called the **learning
rate**. Higher values lead to quicker variations of the parameters,
but also to stability and convergence issues. Too small values
on the other increase the number of steps required to reach an acceptable
maximum. The best solution is often a varying learning rate, adapting
the rate of variations. The rate we choose is the following:  

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"><font size="3">
<img src="http://bit.ly/1mPbuWs" align="center" border="0" alt="\gamma^{(n)} = \alpha\cdot min\left(c_0 ,\ \frac{3}{n^{0.5}+1}\right)" width="239" height="47" />
</font></div>

Which means that the learning rate is constant for all first steps
until:   
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"><font size="3">
<img src="http://bit.ly/1nc65Jx" align="center" border="0" alt="n > \left(\frac{3-c_0}{c_0}  \right)^2" width="122" height="51" />  
</font>  
</div>  

At this point, the learning rate slowly decreases because we assume the
parameters are getting closer to the right value, which we don't want to
overshoot.  

## Decision boundaries and 2D-representation

A **decision region** is the subset of the features space within which the
decision taken by the model is identical. A **decision boundary** is the
subset of the space where the decision "switches". For most algorithms,
the decision taken on the boundary is arbitrary. The possible boundary
shapes are a key characteristic of machine learning algorithms.  

In our case, logistic regression models the logit of the probability,
which is strictly monotonous with the probability as linearly
proportional to the predictors. It can be deduced that the decision
boundary will be a straight line separating the two classes.
This can be visualized using two features of the data, "vari" and
"k_resid":

```python
# variables k_resid, vari
# learning the weights
w = learn_weights(data1.iloc[:,(0,1,3)])

# building the mesh
xmesh, ymesh = np.meshgrid(np.arange(data1["vari"].min()-.5,data1["vari"].max()+.5,.01),\
    np.arange(data1["k_resid"].min()-.5,data1["k_resid"].max()+.5,.01))

pmap = pd.DataFrame(np.c_[np.ones((len(xmesh.ravel()),)),xmesh.ravel(),ymesh.ravel()])
p = np.array([])
for line in pmap.values:
    p = np.append(p,(prob_log(line,w)))

p = p.reshape(xmesh.shape)

plt.contourf(xmesh, ymesh, np.power(p,8), cmap= 'RdBu',alpha=.5)
plt.plot(data1[data1["class"]==1]["vari"],data1[data1["class"]==1]["k_resid"],'+',label='Class 0')
plt.plot(data1[data1["class"]==0]["vari"],data1[data1["class"]==0]["k_resid"],'r+',label='Class 1')
plt.legend(loc="upper right")
plt.title('2-dimension logistic regression result')
plt.xlabel('vari')
plt.ylabel('k_resid')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

# Implementation

## Elementary functions

Modularizing the code increases the readability, we define the
implementations of two mathematical functions:
```python
def prob_log(x,w):
    """
    probability of an observation belonging
    to the class "one"
    given the predictors x and weights w
    """
    return np.exp(np.dot(x,w))/(np.exp(np.dot(x,w))+1)
def grad_log_like(X, y, w):
    """
    computes the gradient of the log-likelihood from predictors X,
    output y and weights w
    """
    return np.dot(X.T,y- np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: prob_log(x,w),1,X)).reshape((len(w),))
```

## Learning algorithm
A function computes the optimal weights from iterations to find the maximal
log-likelihood of the parameters, using the two previous functions.

```python
def learn_weights(df):
    """
    computes and updates the weights until convergence
    given the features and outcome in a data frame
    """
    X = np.c_[np.ones(len(df)),np.array(df.iloc[:,:df.shape[1]-1])]
    y = np.array(df["class"])
    niter = 0
    error = .0001
    w = np.zeros((df.shape[1],))
    w0 = w+5
    alpha = .3
    while sum(abs(w0-w))>error and niter < 10000:
        niter+=1
        w0 = w
        w = w + alpha*min(.1,(3/(niter**.5+1)))*(grad_log_like(X,y,w))
    if niter==10000:
        print("Maximum iterations reached")
    return w
```

## Prediction

Once the weights have been learnt, new probabilities can be predicted from
explanatory variables.

```python
def predict_outcome(df,w):
    """
    takes in a test data set and computed weights
    returns a vector of predicted output, the confusion matrix
    and the number of misclassifications
    """
    confusion_matrix = np.zeros((2,2))
    p = []
    for line in df.values:
        x = np.append(1,line[0:3])
        p.append(prob_log(x,w))
        if (prob_log(x,w)>.5) and line[3]:
            confusion_matrix[1,1]+=1
        elif (prob_log(x,w)<.5) and line[3]:
            confusion_matrix[1,0]+=1
        elif (prob_log(x,w)<.5) and not line[3]:
            confusion_matrix[0,0]+=1
        else:
            confusion_matrix[0,1]+=1
    return p, confusion_matrix, len(df)-sum(np.diag(confusion_matrix))
```

## Cross-validated evaluation

Learning weights on a training subset and getting the error on an other subset
will allow us to estimate the real error rate of our prediction. 100 cross
validations are performed and for each of them, we add the error to a list.

```python
error = []
weights = []
for test in range(100):
    trainIndex = np.random.rand(len(data0)) < 0.85
    data_train = data1[trainIndex]
    data_test = data1[~trainIndex]
    weights.append(learn_weights(data_train))
    error.append(predict_outcome(data_test,weights[-1])[2])
```

The following results were obtained:
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1"><font size="3">
<img src="http://mbesancon.github.io/BankNotes/figures/GLM_errors.png" alt=
"Evolution of the model with different coefficient values" style="width: 400px;"/>
</font>
</div>

The model produces on average 2.66 misclassifications for
100 evaluated banknotes. Note that on each test, 85% of the observations
went into the training set, which is arbitrary. However, too few
training points will yield inaccurate models and higher error rates.

# Improvement perspectives and conclusion

On this data set, we managed to build independent and reliable features and
model the probability of belonging to the forged banknotes class thanks to a
logistic regression model. This appeared to be quite successful from the error
estimation on the test set. However, few further progresses could be made.

## Testing other models

We only implemented the logistic regression from scratch, given that several
models would have increased the length of this article. But some other
algorithms would have been interesting, such as:
* K nearest neighbors
* Support Vector Machine
* Model-based predictions such as naive Bayes or Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
* Classification Tree

Fact of interest: the two first algorithms also build linear decision
boundaries, but based on other criteria.

## Adjusting the costs

We assumed that misclassifying a true banknote was just as bad as doing so for
a forged one. This is why using a limit at p=0.5 was the optimal choice. But
suppose that taking a forged banknote for a genuine one costs twice more than
the opposite error. Then the limit probability will be set at p = 0.25 to
minimize the overall cost. More generally, a **cost matrix** can be built
to minimize the sum of the element-wise product of the cost matrix with the
confusion matrix. Here is an interesting
[Stack Overflow topic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17464229/weka-cost-matrix-interpretation)   
topic on the matter.

## Online classification

The analysis carried on in this article is still far from the objective of some
data projects, which would be to build a reusable online classifier.
In our case, this could be used by bank to instantaneously verify bank notes
received. This raises some new issues like the update of different parameters
and the detection of new patterns.
